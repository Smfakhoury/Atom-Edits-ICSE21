Results of the experiment (% indicate percentage of gazes retained):
| Data Sampling Rate | Visual Studio | Eclipse | Atom   |
|--------------------|---------------|---------|--------|
| 60Hz               | 64.16%        | 100%    | 100%   |
| 120Hz              | 37.43%        | 100%    | 100%   |
| 150Hz              | 35.31%        | 98.43%  | 99.86% |
| 300Hz              | 19.66%        | 94.86%  | 99.95% |
| 1000Hz             | 6.38%         | 29.17%  | 99.92% |
